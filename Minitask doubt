MINI TASK TEST CASE 5 PROBLEM
The OrangeHRM demo site does not allow actual creation of new users. After filling the form correctly and clicking the “Save” button:

The site does not process or save the user

No redirect or confirmation occurs

The user is not added to the system

Login with the new user fails

TimeoutExceptions occur because the app waits for the success screen which never comes.
What should i do next
